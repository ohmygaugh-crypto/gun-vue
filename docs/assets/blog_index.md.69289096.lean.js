Then there's an overview of some new and updated features of the app and all it's layers. We got \`Stability +10\` and great UI design improvements since v.0.5.0. I've added full zip-file support meaning you can upload and download zip-files with you posts and the app will easily handle them client-side. \\n\\n<p>You'll see the more reliable version of the Space, fast and beautiful Feeds and some Users browsing experience. I try to make everything  as modular as I can, so you can imagine how you could combine all these blocks to create some fun p2p web-apps yourself.

With v 0.7 we introduce the concept of rooms, that are separate SEA key pairs for use with certificates. Any logged in user can do create some records inside the app room based of a set of certificates, restricting the posting rules. Posts, spaces, users and even rooms are already easily addable to any room by any user. And anyone can create a new room to fill up as he/she wishes.
